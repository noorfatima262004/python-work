### what is tkinter:

Tkinter is a simple and easy-to-use library in Python for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It allows you to build windows, buttons, text fields, and other interactive elements. It's great for beginners because it comes built into Python, so you donâ€™t need extra installations. Tkinter helps turn your Python code into user-friendly applications with visual interfaces.


### Explanation in Simple Terms:

1. `import tkinter as tk`:
   - What it does: Imports the `tkinter` module and renames it as `tk`.
   - Why: This lets you use `tk` as a short and convenient way to access `tkinter` functions like `tk.Tk()`, `tk.Label()`, etc.

2. `from tkinter import messagebox`:
   - What it does: Imports only the `messagebox` module from `tkinter`.
   - Why: This allows you to use `messagebox.showinfo()` directly without needing to prefix it with `tk.`.

3. `import ` (Import Everything)**:
   - What it does: Imports everything from a module.
   - Why: Not recommended because it can clutter your code and cause conflicts with other functions that have the same name.

### Difference:
- `import tkinter as tk`: Imports the entire `tkinter` module and gives it an alias (`tk`). You access everything under `tk`, like `tk.Button()`.
- `from tkinter import messagebox`: Only imports the `messagebox` part of `tkinter`. You can use `messagebox` directly without the `tk.` prefix.
- `import *`: Imports everything from a module, which can lead to confusion because you won't know exactly what functions are available.

### When to Use Each:
- `import tkinter as tk`: When you want to use multiple parts of `tkinter` and prefer clear code with the `tk.` prefix.
- `from tkinter import ...`: When you only need specific features and want shorter code for those features.
- `import *`: Avoid unless you're very familiar with the module and want quick access to all its features.
